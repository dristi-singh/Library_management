# Library Management System

A comprehensive C++ application for managing library operations using MySQL database integration.

## Overview

This Library Management System is designed to help librarians efficiently manage books, members, and lending transactions in a library environment. The system provides a command-line interface with features for tracking book inventory, member records, and book lending/return operations.

## Features

- **Book Management**
  - Add new books to the library
  - Update book details (title, author, copies)
  - Remove books from the inventory
  - View complete list of available books

- **Member Management**
  - Register new library members
  - Update member information
  - Remove members from the system
  - View all registered members

- **Transaction Management**
  - Record book lending operations
  - Process book returns
  - Track lending history
  - Delete transaction records

## Database Structure

The system utilizes a MySQL database with the following tables:

1. **Books**
   - `id` (Primary Key, Auto-increment)
   - `title` (VARCHAR)
   - `author` (VARCHAR)
   - `year` (INT)
   - `copies` (INT)

2. **Lenders**
   - `id` (Primary Key, Auto-increment)
   - `name` (VARCHAR)
   - `email` (VARCHAR, Unique)
   - `phone` (VARCHAR)
   - `joined_on` (DATE)

3. **Transactions**
   - `id` (Primary Key, Auto-increment)
   - `book_id` (Foreign Key referencing books)
   - `member_id` (Foreign Key referencing lenders)
   - `date_issued` (TIMESTAMP)
   - `date_returned` (DATE, can be NULL for ongoing loans)

## Technical Requirements

- C++ compiler
- MySQL server
- MySQL C++ Connector library

## Installation and Setup

1. Install MySQL server and client libraries
2. Install the MySQL Connector/C++ development files
3. Compile the code with the MySQL libraries:

   mysql_real_connect(conn, "localhost", "username", "password", NULL, 3306, NULL, 0)
   ```

## Usage
